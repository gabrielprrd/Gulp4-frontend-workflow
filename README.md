# Gulp 4 Workflow

A small project using gulp tasks to enhance performance and modularity on the front end development. The project uses Sass to write more readable and well organized css, Babel and Browserify for ES6 support and plugins for minify everything.


## Prerequisites

Make sure you have gulp installed globally

```
npm install gulp-cli -g
```

### Front End Development

I use this only for front end development. This doesn't have back end tools or focus on Wordpress themes.

## Tools

- Gulp 4.0.0
- Browserify 16.2.3
- Babelify 10.0.0
- Gulp-autoprefixer 6.0.0
- Gulp-imagemin": "^5.0.3",
- Gulp-rename 1.4.0
- Gulp-sass 4.0.2
- Gulp-sourcemaps 2.6.4
- Gulp-uglify 3.0.1
- Vinyl-buffer 1.0.1
- Vinyl-source-stream 2.0.0

### About browser-sync

This workflow doesn't use browser-sync because it's way easier to simply use [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) if you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Happy coding!
